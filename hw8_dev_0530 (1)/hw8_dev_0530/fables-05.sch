There once was a fox and a fowl.  The fox was nightly prowling a yard.  He was stealing the fowl.  

An agriculturist began to be annoyed by the fox.  

The agriculturist set a trap and caught the fox.  

The agriculturist tied some fiber onto the tail of the fox and in order to retaliate.  

The agriculturist kindled the fiber and freed the fox.  

The agriculturist began to be unlucky because the fox ran into a field.  

Some corn began to be ripe in the field and began to be ready to a harvest.  

The corn ignited and burned completely.  

The agriculturist lost a crop.
