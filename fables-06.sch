There once was a lion.  The lion was sleeping in a lair.  

The lion awaked because a mouse ran into the face of the lion.  

The lion lost temper and seized the mouse with the paw of the lion.  

The lion began attacking the mouse.  

The mouse began to be extremely frightened and piteously entreated the lion to spare it.  

The mouse said that -- if the lion were to free the mouse -- the mouse would repay kindness.  

The lion began to be amused.  

The lion laughed aloud because he thought that the mouse is extremely not able to help him.  

The lion good-naturedly freed the mouse.  

Opportunity arrived.  

A trapper spread some net in order to catch a big game.  

The lion entangled himself in the net.  

The mouse heard that the lion was roaring with anger.  

The mouse recognized the voice of the lion.  

The mouse ran to the lion.  

The mouse immediately began gnawing the rope of the net with the tooth of the mouse.  

The mouse soon succeeded in freeing the lion.  

The mouse said that the lion had aloud laughed because he thought that the mouse is extremely not able to help him.  

The mouse said that the lion was seeing that the mouse is able to help him.
